bh is a toy web server in bash.

Currently it is just for fun, is unfinished and probably inconsistent. You
shouldn't consider it as anything but a curiosity and a stub for further
development.

It

   * uses netcat or socat to acquire connections
   * serves local files with the help of common unix commands
   * has a few simple functions for html generation
   * is able to compress output

Help? See source.
